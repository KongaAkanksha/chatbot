Creating a chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been an enlightening and rewarding experience. This project involved designing a user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS, ensuring the chatbot is both visually appealing and accessible. The core functionality was implemented using JavaScript, where I integrated logic for processing user inputs, generating responses, as of now only the users echo is generated to maintain the interactive flow.
